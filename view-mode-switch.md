###What does it do?
It is a website that displays a list of items in two separate ways: a list view and an icon/column/portfolio view.  Plus it's responsive.
###What interactive elements exist?
Rollover buttons that change color on hover.  a header with two icons that change color on hover, and stay the changed color once clicked...these buttons also change the css layout from list style to portfolio style when clicked (herein lies the real magic).
###How do you interact with them?
mouseover and clicking.
###What visual effects are produced by interacting?
color changes, total style change.
###How does it do it?
By switching between css style sheets on header-icon click.
###What existing HTML elements are changed?
the link to each css stylesheet.
###What new HTML elements are created?
I'm actually not sure that there are any elements changed.  I'm currently operating on the assumption that the links to both stylesheets exist in the html, we are just changing which sheet is actively being linked.
###What CSS styles are used to produce the effect?
Two separate stylesheets.  Some hovers.  Magic.
